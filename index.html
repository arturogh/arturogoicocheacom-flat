<p class="mid-gray f2 pt2 pb3 lh-copy measure">Nice to meet you. This is me, incrementally:</p>

<p class="near-black f2 pt2 pb3 lh-copy measure">Peruvian designer working at Microsoft, living in Seattle, WA.</p>

<p class="near-black f3 pv2 lh-copy measure">Build / design with code, through deep understanding, and collaboration. Self-taught. Father of 2, husband of 1. Photographer. Introvert, thinker, ponderer.</p>

<p class="near-black f3 pv2 lh-copy measure">My personal mission is to positively impact the world. I haven’t focused on an area yet (finance, education, etc), and am currently gaining and refining my skills. My role right now is pushing my coding skills (React + TypeScript). Previously, I was designing through prototyping with Framer. Enjoy big, complex problems. My future is open, and the present is an ongoing exploration.</p>
